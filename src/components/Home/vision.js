                  The National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), established on February 7, 1976, by the Ministry of 
Health and Family Welfare, India, is an autonomous body under the Department of AYUSH. It 
aims to promote the growth and development of Ayurveda, produce graduates and postgraduates in all branches, and provide medical care through Ayurveda. The institute offers a range 
of programs, including BAMS, diploma, and Ph.D. courses. It has a 280-bed NABH-accredited
hospital and modern research facilities. NIA is recognised for its excellence in teaching, training, 
and patient care at national and international levels. Recently, NIA established a Manuscript Unit 
focused on digitising and preserving rare Ayurveda manuscripts and books, supporting research 
and enhancing the global understanding of Ayurveda. The Manuscript Unit also collaborates with 
various institutions to share and explore valuable historical medical texts.
The Ayurveda Manuscripts Research Registry of India (AMRRI) is a centralized database focused 
on preserving and facilitating research on Ayurveda manuscripts. Our mission is to create an 
extensive, paperless repository that supports the study and preservation of these ancient texts.
Declaration as the Nodal Agency The Manuscriptology unit of NIA was conferred with the nodal 
agency status on 11.12.2020 by the Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India, with the blessings of 
Honourable Secretary of AYUSH, Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha."
We require researchers to submit and upload permission or approval letters from their 
institutions or manuscript repository centres, if applicable. All submissions are conducted 
online, and verification is done through email, ensuring a streamlined, digital process.
Registration with AMRRI is free and open to reputable registrants, researchers, and users, with 
principal investigators or primary sponsors authorized to register studies. While we currently 
maintain a consistent dataset for all manuscript studies, the AYUSH ministry plans to make 
registration mandatory to prevent redundancy and gather comprehensive metadata.
For studies related to Ayurveda manuscripts, necessary consent and approval forms must be 
submitted. Although no certificates are issued upon registration, the AMRRI number will be 
publicly viewable and searchable on our website, allowing researchers to generate PDF copies of 
registered studies for submission to relevant authorities.
AMRRI ensures a completely paperless experience, making all submissions and document 
uploads digital. For any inquiries, please contact us at www.amrri.in with the subject "AMRRI 
number" in the body of the email.
Join us in our effort to preserve and promote the invaluable heritage of Ayurveda manuscripts
