            In the context of the Ayurveda Manuscripts Research Registry of
            India, a manuscript registry is a database or collection of
            information related to manuscripts. It refers to a registry
            specifically focused on Ayurveda manuscripts in India. This
            registry aims to create a centralized database of Ayurveda
            manuscripts in India to facilitate research and preservation
            efforts.
